IDEA: instead of agent input being [requesting_node, node_state, task], what if its just [node_state, task] and it instead outputs a 9-vector of scores for each node. We then assign to all idle nodes the most appropiate task

-> change line 24 of env to not be hardcoded (np.zeros)
-> change the NodeCluster state to keep track of the expected duration & update that instead of the start time
